*Well, well... 
Greetings, future long-sufferers, your adventure starts here!)*

In this repository u can find many really good things (maybe). For the beginners i recommend branch "main" and folder beggining. There u can see VERY MANY FILES, for orientation in space, u MUST use the number of file or u will die, i promise.
